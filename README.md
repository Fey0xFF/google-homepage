This is my first 'real' assignment on The Odin Project taking off one of the several training wheels :).   

This project contains an HTML and CSS build of the Google home page.    

I've commented throughout the code for others to see what I did and why as I played with a few different styles as I went to test and learn new things. I mixed up what Googles documentation used and my own approach in chunks, i.e. a top navbar done in a list and one done as spans. There's advantages and disadvantages to both!

If you're reading this - I hope you enjoy my content and that you go on ahead and try experimenting too. Great way to learn! :)
